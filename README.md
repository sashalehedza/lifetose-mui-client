# Description
MERN project! All features is too long to explain so you can test it by yourself :) Kidding,
I developed the app for creating orders, processing their status, divided the possibilities into visitor, registered and admin users. Now an visitor has the ability to view products, search for products by name or by tag, similar products, a registered user has the ability to like, comment, reply to comments, creating order, view their orders, in addition to what an visitor user has, the administrator has the ability to create, edit and delete products, view all user orders and change order status in addition to what an registered user has.
